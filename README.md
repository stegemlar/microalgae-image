## The files are organized as follows: 

* [Build CNN](https://github.com/stegemlar/microalgae-image/blob/main/Build%20CNN.ipynb) contains the construction, optimization, training, validation and evaluation (SHAP) of the Convolutional Neural Network 
* [Use CNN](https://github.com/stegemlar/microalgae-image/blob/main/Use%20CNN.ipynb) can be used to clasiify images using a trained Convolutional Neural Network
* [Build XGBoost](https://github.com/stegemlar/microalgae-image/blob/main/Build%20XGBoost.ipynb) contains the construction, optimization, training, validation and evaluation (SHAP) of the Gradient Boosting Decision tree model (XGBoost)
* [Use XGBoost](https://github.com/stegemlar/microalgae-image/blob/main/Use%20XGBoost.ipynb) can be used to clasiify images using a trained XGBoost model

The [Dataset](https://github.com/stegemlar/microalgae-image/blob/main/Sorted%20Dataset%20Haematococcus%20cell%20cycle.zip) contains the dataset used for model training and validation 
  The file contains one subfolder for each class ('Greenflag', 'Greenround', 'Others', 'Redflag' and 'Redround')
